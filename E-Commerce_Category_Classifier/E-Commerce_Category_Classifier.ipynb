    "The goal is to train a Machine Learning model that will be able to predict the category of an item using only the title, since the category might be missing sometimes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The required tasks:\n",
    " <br> \n",
    "1. Load the data. As the information has only two labels, not much preparation is needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n",
    "<b>Optional:</b> Most of the entries are in English, but some titles might be in other languages. \n",
    "Removing the entries in other languages might improve the model performance so feel free to remove them before training (feel free to use 3rd party libraries!)\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Test three different classification models. Represent their performance visually through confussion matrices/classification reports & choose the best model. Use grid search to pick the best hyper-parameters. Justify your decisions. \n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "3. In order to make predictions the text has to be transformed into an usable vector (in case of doubt, you can refer to `help(sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer`). Build a pipeline that includes at least the vectorizer & the classifcation model you chose, so that a prediction can be made by directly inputing a text label.\n",
    " <br>\n",
    "4. Add a prediction label to the original dataframe & plot the results divided by category & number of correct predictions.\n",
    " <br>\n",
    "5. Update the \"predictions\" dictionary with the corresponding prediction from the final model. Use the pipeline!\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "5. *Optional: attached with the results include a .joblib file called \"category_classifier\" with the model ready to use!*\n",
